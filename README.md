# Pomoplan

Pomoplan is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) app built with
healthy and productive task management in mind. The goal of Pomoplan is to help
you manage work intervals (known as a _pomodoro_) to with taking breaks to reset
your mind and staying focused during the interval-based work sessions.

## Inspiration

The application was inspired by wanting to experiment with
[React-DnD](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/about) and my personal goal to
work on self-care by adding structured breaks into my task-based work schedule.
The balance between the break timer and work session timer is based on the
[Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

## Features

Each work session can be between 20-30 minutes. The first three pomodoros are
followed by a 5-minute break, while the fourth pomodoro is followed by a 15-30
minute break. You can choose the length of your pomodoros (20-30 minutes) and
the length of your fourth break (15-30 minutes).
